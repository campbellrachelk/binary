Work in progress. I have a solution for most numbers working currently, but don't love the way it's written. I'm thinking of a better solution. Currently doesn't work for 0 and 1, which is a bummer. I could slap a band-aid on it but I'd rather encorporate those cases into my solution natively. We'll see.
